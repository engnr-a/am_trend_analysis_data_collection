Mikey Tibble,@mikeytibble,2021-01-23T04:41:46.000Z,Think the worst part of having a  3D printer  is that you can only do about three prints a day and that’s small objects. You want a big print done it will take about 20 hours and will cost you sleep fearing you’ll wake up to a spaghetti mess,0,0,0,0
