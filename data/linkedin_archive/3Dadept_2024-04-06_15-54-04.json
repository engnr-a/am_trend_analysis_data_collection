Today, aerospace companies using AM have clearly understood the value proposition AM can bring to their production activities. The challenge now consists in going beyond their current use of the technology. This January/February edition of #3DADEPT Mag provides a picture of how AM transforms aircraft design and production. With stories from AM users and insights into related processes, it provides an avenue to explore the various possibilities currently available on the market.\n\n\u2728 Exclusive features \u2728\n\n\u2714\ufe0f DOSSIER\u00a0| How does AM transform aircraft design and production today?\u00a0\nWith contributions from GKN Aerospace\u2019s S\u00e9bastien Aknouche & Materialise\u2019s Erik de Zeeuw.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Business\u00a0| The \u201cfall and rise\u201d of desktop 3D printing\nAs the industry strives for the #industrialization of AM, it\u2019s fair to reassess the importance and current place of desktop 3D printing in this journey. CONTEXT\u2019 Chris Connery and Mosaic Manufacturing\u2019s Mitch Debora share insights here.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Post-processing\u00a0| The use of HIP for critical 3D printed parts: introduction and applications\nWith key insights from Aalberts surface technologies\u2019 Gregory Lane\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Materials | Using composites to replace #metal parts in Additive Manufacturing: when and how?\n#Composites benefit from a century of research into the production of components with subtractive techniques. However, when combined with AM, a couple of points need to be considered. Michele Tonizzo from moi composites helped us figure out which ones.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f AM Shapers\u00a0| Agile Space Industries on the use of Additive Manufacturing in in-space propulsion systems\n\nApart from electric #propulsion systems used for commercial communications satellites, most of the rocket engines in service today are chemical rockets. This type of propulsion system presents several challenges that need to be prioritized to deliver high value for the in-space propulsion market. In its list of priorities, Agile Space Industries discusses the challenges where #AdditiveManufacturing plays a pivotal role.

Named\u00a0Stoke Space, the company headquartered in Kent, Washington joins the New Space era with the goal of delivering\u00a0low-cost, on-demand access to and from any orbit.\nTo do so, it bets on AM to design and manufacture #copper thrust chambers. Given their complex inner structures (regenerative cooling channels and built-in manifolds), it\u2019s often difficult to achieve a reliable depowdering process of the 3D printed parts. That's where Solukon\u2019s SFM-AT800-S comes into play. \n\nMentions: Zachary Sander - Andreas Hartmann #space #depowdering #additivemanufacturing\nhttps://lnkd.in/ed5SBErs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Stoke Space bets on Solukon to address depowdering challenge of 3D printed copper thrust chambers\n            \n\n                https://3dadept.com\n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    6\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Share"

We began this work in earnest in 2019 when we started to leave the prototyping space with the launch of the Meltio M450. After learning from and improving the technology for three years, the time was finally ripe for us to work on the next system. Our goal with the Meltio M600 was to strike the right balance between machine size, cost, and productivity while being uncompromising on quality, reliability, and ease of use. To achieve this, we developed every single part of the machine from scratch to take the #technology to the next level, based on the learnings of having manufactured and installed over 300 Laser DED machines.\u201d  Meet the Meltio M600 \ud83d\udc47\n\n#3dprinter #BlueLaser\nhttps://lnkd.in/eisk8PRq\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Meltio unveils new metal 3D printer with a Blue Laser deposition head\n            \n\n                https://3dadept.com\n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    43\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                1 Comment\n            \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Share"

At the time, the founding industry users group was called\u00a03D Systems North American Stereolithography Users Group,\u00a0users group solely focused on the advancement of stereolithography (SL) use with the owners and operators of 3D Systems Corporation\u2019 equipment. Today, AMUG educates and supports users of all #additivemanufacturing technologies. And the best part is, while AM companies can provide support in the organization of the event, this \u201copen space\u201d style has allowed users to shape the development of hardware, software, materials, and applications based on their needs.\nTo help the industry prepare for the 2024 edition of this important event for the AM community, we asked\u00a0Shannon VanDeren (AMUG \ud83e\udd95), President of AMUG, to share the highlights of their 2023 event and what will make their event worthy to be attended in 2024.

To do so, they will rely on #additivemanufacturing to develop large-scale carbon composite structures for #rockets. \n\nA timely research to demonstrate the different alternatives to #metal #additivemanufacturing in the #space industry. \n\nRead more below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe\n\nNew Frontier Technologies - The Australian National University - @Australian Advanced Instrumentation Centre - Darin Lovett - Paul Compston - #Australia\nhttps://lnkd.in/eCxywi8p\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The iLAuNCH project team relies on AM of large-scale composite structures to build a rocket\n            \n\n                https://3dadept.com\n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    2\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Share"
