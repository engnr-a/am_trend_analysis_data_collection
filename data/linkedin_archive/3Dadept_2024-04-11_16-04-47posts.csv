3Dadept,2024-03-11,"[🗣 The January/February edition of hashtag#3DADEPTMag is out!! 🚨🚨] – 📌 LINK in the FIRST comment! 📌 We kick-off hashtag#volume 7 of hashtag#3DADEPTMag with a focus on hashtag#Aerospace and hashtag#Space, two vertical industries driving the growth of hashtag#AdditiveManufacturing (AM) technologies. Today, aerospace companies using AM have clearly understood the value proposition AM can bring to their production activities. The challenge now consists in going beyond their current use of the technology. This January/February edition of hashtag#3DADEPT Mag provides a picture of how AM transforms aircraft design and production. With stories from AM users and insights into related processes, it provides an avenue to explore the various possibilities currently available on the market.✨ Exclusive features ✨✔️ DOSSIER | How does AM transform aircraft design and production today? With contributions from GKN Aerospace’s Sébastien Aknouche & Materialise’s Erik de Zeeuw.✔️ Business | The “fall and rise” of desktop 3D printingAs the industry strives for the hashtag#industrialization of AM, it’s fair to reassess the importance and current place of desktop 3D printing in this journey. CONTEXT’ Chris Connery and Mosaic Manufacturing’s Mitch Debora share insights here.✔️ Post-processing | The use of HIP for critical 3D printed parts: introduction and applicationsWith key insights from Aalberts surface technologies’ Gregory Lane✔️ Materials | Using composites to replace hashtag#metal parts in Additive Manufacturing: when and how?hashtag#Composites benefit from a century of research into the production of components with subtractive techniques. However, when combined with AM, a couple of points need to be considered. Michele Tonizzo from moi composites helped us figure out which ones.✔️ AM Shapers | Agile Space Industries on the use of Additive Manufacturing in in-space propulsion systemsApart from electric hashtag#propulsion systems used for commercial communications satellites, most of the rocket engines in service today are chemical rockets. This type of propulsion system presents several challenges that need to be prioritized to deliver high value for the in-space propulsion market. In its list of priorities, Agile Space Industries discusses the challenges where hashtag#AdditiveManufacturing plays a pivotal role. (Benjamin Graybill & Dustin Crouse)✔️ Interview of the Month with Robert Pohorenec | How 7 decades of expertise in electron beam technology have helped position JEOL USA in the AM marketEvents ✔️ Greg Morris, the AMUG (Additive Manufacturing Users Group) “Innovations Award Winner” on his journey, the adoption of AM across industries and the future of Zeda ✔️ Additive Manufacturing for Aerospace, Defence & Space conference (by Defence iQ)hashtag#additivemanufacturing hashtag#materials hashtag#space hashtag#postprocessing hashtag#business hashtag#desktop hashtag#3dprintingACCESS The Digital Mag Here 👉 https://lnkd.in/edMvcQqH

This combination makes it possible to identify the various semantic layers of the 2D drawing and thus to interpret the technical drawing in an optimal way for its 3D reconstruction”.

If their manufacturing process does not meet certain expectations, they can result in an unexpected reduction of human flexibility leading to new sources of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) and accidents. Furthermore, depending on what led someone to wear such a device, exoskeletons may often represent a psychological burden for the patient due to their aesthetic and functional impairment – let alone the cost of the final device.All these pain points can be addressed using advanced manufacturing technologies. The basic questions are: What? Why? How? Beyond these questions, there is a need to understand how to shorten a manufacturing process that is still described as lengthy and full of complexities. These are the questions we will discuss in the next hashtag#additivetalks session. With contributions from ActivArmor's Diana Hall and University of Central Lancashire's Matthew Dickinson. hashtag#additivemanufacturing hashtag#3dadeptmag hashtag#exoskeletons https://lnkd.in/es9UsxJ5
