3Dadept,2024-03-07,"[🗣 The January/February edition of hashtag#3DADEPTMag is out!! 🚨🚨] – 📌 LINK in the FIRST comment! 📌 We kick-off hashtag#volume 7 of hashtag#3DADEPTMag with a focus on hashtag#Aerospace and hashtag#Space, two vertical industries driving the growth of hashtag#AdditiveManufacturing (AM) technologies. Today, aerospace companies using AM have clearly understood the value proposition AM can bring to their production activities. The challenge now consists in going beyond their current use of the technology. This January/February edition of hashtag#3DADEPT Mag provides a picture of how AM transforms aircraft design and production. With stories from AM users and insights into related processes, it provides an avenue to explore the various possibilities currently available on the market.✨ Exclusive features ✨✔️ DOSSIER | How does AM transform aircraft design and production today? With contributions from GKN Aerospace’s Sébastien Aknouche & Materialise’s Erik de Zeeuw.✔️ Business | The “fall and rise” of desktop 3D printingAs the industry strives for the hashtag#industrialization of AM, it’s fair to reassess the importance and current place of desktop 3D printing in this journey. CONTEXT’ Chris Connery and Mosaic Manufacturing’s Mitch Debora share insights here.✔️ Post-processing | The use of HIP for critical 3D printed parts: introduction and applicationsWith key insights from Aalberts surface technologies’ Gregory Lane✔️ Materials | Using composites to replace hashtag#metal parts in Additive Manufacturing: when and how?hashtag#Composites benefit from a century of research into the production of components with subtractive techniques. However, when combined with AM, a couple of points need to be considered. Michele Tonizzo from moi composites helped us figure out which ones.✔️ AM Shapers | Agile Space Industries on the use of Additive Manufacturing in in-space propulsion systemsApart from electric hashtag#propulsion systems used for commercial communications satellites, most of the rocket engines in service today are chemical rockets. This type of propulsion system presents several challenges that need to be prioritized to deliver high value for the in-space propulsion market. In its list of priorities, Agile Space Industries discusses the challenges where hashtag#AdditiveManufacturing plays a pivotal role.

This combination makes it possible to identify the various semantic layers of the 2D drawing and thus to interpret the technical drawing in an optimal way for its 3D reconstruction”.
